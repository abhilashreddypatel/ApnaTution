        // So `POST /leads/:id/unlock` from Step 6 is for "Manual/Free/Different" unlock?
        // Step 6 controller: `unlockLead` creates `LeadUnlock` with dummy price 99.
        // Step 8 controller: `verifyPayment` creates `LeadUnlock` with price 99 after verify.
        // So Step 6's endpoint is the "insecure" or "dev" unlock.

        // But for now I'll include it just in case.
